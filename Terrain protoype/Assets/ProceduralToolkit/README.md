# Procedural Toolkit v0.1.6

Procedural Toolkit is a collection of instruments for creating procedural generation systems. It is free, open source and does not require a Unity Pro license.

**Warning: Be aware that this is a programming toolkit, editor support is limited.**

## Classes
* RandomE: Random extensions for arrays, value generators.
* MeshE: Mesh extensions and constructors for primitives.
* MeshDraft: helper class for procedural mesh generation.
* TextureE: Texture extensions and constructors.
* ColorE: Color extensions, HTML colors.
* PTUtils: useful utility methods.
* Datasets: various data.

## Editor classes
* ProceduralToolkitMenu: constructors for primitives and about window.
* MeshFilterExtension: Mesh saver.
